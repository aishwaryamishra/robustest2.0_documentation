Creating and running automation test cases considerably speeds up the testing process and helps reduce human error.

RobusTest enables you to create automation test cases in a quick and easy way with minimal to zero coding.

Any Automation testing plan should comprise of the following 3 components:

1. Creating an automation test case
2. Running or Executing an automation test case 
3. Generating run reports


In order to start an automation test session:

1. Click on the 'Automation' icon on the Project Dashboard
   
   A device selection screen now pops up. You may search for a device on the 'Device selection screen' based on device name, platform version, screen size, hardware configuration (e.g. Memory and CPU),  node name, node IP, etc.
 
2. Select the device you wish to test on by clicking on the 'Select' button under the device
   
   The device screen now comes up and you can see that your app is installed on the device.

   Your automation test creation session is now in progress 


You can click on the 'End Session' button to end the recording session.
