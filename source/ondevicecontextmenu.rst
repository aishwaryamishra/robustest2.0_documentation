When you hover your mouse pointer over the app that you are testing, you will notice a rectangular placeholder overlaid on top of various objects on the screen. You can also find the name of the object that is currently selected in the header. When a particular object is highlighted using the placeholder, it is selected and you can record various actions related to that object. Upon clicking on an object, you will get recording options related to that object. Some of the popular actions are

1. **Tap** - this records a Tap action on the object that you have selected.
2. **Click** - this records a Click action on the object that you have selected.
3. **Long Press** - this records a Long Press action on the object that you have selected.
4. **Zoom** - this records a Zoom In action on the screen
5. **Pinch** - this records a Zoom Out action on the screen
6. **Verify Object** - this option allows user to create a check (or an assertion as automation engineers would call them) on an object. In the verify dialog, you will notice all the attributes for the object is selected, along with their respective values. If you wish to place a check on a particular object attribute(s), just check the box next to it. When the test case runs, it will check to ensure that the value for that attribute is as expected. In case the value is not as expected, the test step fails.
7. **Inspect Element** - this option allows user to study the object and its attributes. This is useful for advanced users and for debugging.
