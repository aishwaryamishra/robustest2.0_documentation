Verifying element attribute values
===================================

RobusTest provides you a means to compare attribute values of an element with:-

a. a custom value ; Or;
b. that of the attribute value of another element

We refer to this process as a verification.

A verification is done by comparing a **'Source'** attribute value with a **'Target'** attribute value.

When a verification is recorded, a corresponding test step is created.

Details of the verification can be seen in the 'User Data' section of the verification test step that is recorded.

On RobusTest, a verification can be done in two ways:-

1. by using the 'Verify Element' option see :ref:`verify-element`.
2. by using the 'Verification' option


**1. Verification using the 'Verify Element' option**

   
  In an Automation test session, as you move the mouse pointer over the device screen, you will see different rectangular boxes being displayed.

  Each box highlights an element on the current app screen/page.

   
   .. image:: _static/verifyelement1.png



  Hover the pointer over an element (so that a rectangle is displayed) and perform a left-click. You will see a context menu open up.

  On the context menu, click on the option 'Verify Element'

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement2.png


  You now see a 'Create Verification' window pop up

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement3.png
   

  On this window you can see the following:-

  1. Source
  2. Target
  3. 'Add Verification Step' button
  4. 'Invert Verification Result' checkbox

  We shall understand each of the above terms as we proceed further


  The first step for any verification is to identify the 'Source' element

  When executing a 'Verify Element' action, the 'Source' is always going to be the element on which the left-click was performed.
  Hence, the 'Source' field on the top left corner of the window is disabled by default.

  If the Source element has a value present for its 'text' attribute, then, this value will be displayed under 'Source'. In the example above, the element has the value 'Login' for its 'text' attribute. 

  The second step is to identify a 'Target' element

  This can be done in two ways:-

  1. By directly using the 'Add Verification Step' button
  2. By using the 'Target' drop down


  **1. Directly using the 'Add Verification Step' button**
  
     The 'Add Verification Step' option is used when you want to compare the value of the Source attribute with that of a custom value 

     Click on the 'Add Verification Step' button. A verificaiton row is seen added


     .. image:: _static/verifyelement4.png



     On the verification row, you need to select 3 values:-

     1. the Source attribute
     2. the condition to be evaluated (or comparison criterion)
     3. the Target attribute

     **1. the Source attribute**

        On clicking on the 'Source' attribute drop down, a list of all the attributes associated with the source element, along with their values, are displayed. 

        Select the attribute whose value you want to compare by clicking on it.

        Let us click on the 'text' attribute in this example

        .. image:: _static/verifyelement5.png

     
     **2. the condition to be evaluated**

        Click on the 'Conditions' drop down. A list of various conditions can be seen.

        The conditions '*is exactly*', '*contains*' and '*is contained in*' are used for string comparisons

        The conditions '*=*', '*<*', '*>*', '*<=*' and '*>=*' are used for numeric comparisons  
     
        Select the condition to be checked by clicking on it.

        Let us click on the condition 'is exactly' in this example

        .. image:: _static/verifyelement6.png


     **3. the Target attribute**

        By default, the Target element in this case is the same as the Source element

        On clicking on the 'Target' attribute drop down, a list of all the values associated with the attributes of the element are displayed. 

        Also note that the text in this drop down is editable.

        You now have two options here:-

        1. Click on a value on the drop down. This value will be compared against the Source attribute value
                                         OR
        2. Manually enter a value in the target attribute field to be compared against


        **1. Click on a value on the drop down.**

           .. image:: _static/verifyelement7.png

   
           This option can be used to ensure that the expected value is being displayed or populated for that attribute


           .. image:: _static/verifyelement8.png




           The above verification can be read as follows: 

           *Is the value in the text attribute of the Source element exactly the same as the value present in the Target attribute field ?*

           E.g. Is the text on the Login button exactly the same as 'Login'





        **2. Manually enter a value in the target attribute field**
            

           This option can be used to enter custom values in the target attribute field	manually           

           .. image:: _static/verifyelement9.png



  **2. By using the 'Target' drop down**

     This option may be used when you want to compare the value of the Source attribute with that of a value stored in a previous test step

     The previous test step, in this case, should always be a 'Store Element' test step. Hence you need to perform a 'Store Element' action on that element.

     The details of the attribute values available for comparison may be viewed in the 'Return Data' section of the 'Store Element' test step that is recorded




     The Target element may be selected from the list of test steps displayed in the Target drop down.


     .. image:: _static/verifyelement13.png


     On clicking on the 'Add Verification Step' button. A verification row is seen

     Select the Source attribute, the comparison criterion and Target attribute from their resppective drop downs.

     .. image:: _static/verifyelement14.png

     We now have the following comparison recorded:

     .. image:: _static/verifyelement15.png


     The above verification can be read as follows: 

     *Is the value in the text attribute of the Source element exactly the same as the value present in the text attribute of the Target element ?*

     E.g. Is the item name on the product page exactly the same as the item name on the search list


     **Note:** *The Target element will always be a 'Store' test step.*


**2. Verification using the 'Verification' option**

   The second way in which a verification step can be recorded is by clicking on the 'Verification' button on the top horizontal menu


   This method is used when the attribute values of two different test steps are to be compared with one another.

   
   .. image:: _static/verifyelement10.png


   On clicking on this button, the 'Create Verification' pop up window comes up

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement12.png   


   In this case, both the Source and Target elements to be used for comparison have to be selected from their respective dropdowns

   A point to be kept in mind is that in order to do a comparison, it is imperative that the test steps selected in the two drop downs are both 'Store' test steps

   Hence, a 'Store Element' action should be performed on both, the Source and Target elements that are to be compared

   The details of the attribute values available for comparison may be viewed in the 'Return Data' section of the two 'Store Element' test steps that are recorded

   Let us look at an example to understand this method of verification

   E.g. Let us say, we are on an app page where a list of items are being displayed. We need to verify that the name of the first item on the list is displayed correctly if we go to the item's product page by clicking on it


   .. image:: _static/verifyelement16.png

   
   Perform a 'Store Element' action on the item name. A store test step is seen recorded.
   Now click on the item name to go to the product page

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement17.png


   On the Product page, perform a 'Store Element' action on the item name

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement18.png


   Now, click on the 'Verification' button on the horizontal menu bar at the top. A 'Create Verification' window opens up

   On the 'Create Verification' window, click on the 'Source' drop down and select the first 'Store' test step, i.e., the one where details of the item name of the first item in the list are stored

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement19.png

   On the 'Target' drop down. select the second 'Store' test step, i.e, the one where the details of the item name on the product page are stored.

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement20.png


   Click on the 'Add Verificaiton Step' button. A verification row is seen created.

   On the verification row, select the source and target attributes as well as the condition to be evaluated.

   In this example, we will select the Source 'text' attribute and the Target 'text' attribute. We will also select the condition 'is exactly'. 

   .. image:: _static/verifyelement21.png

   
   Now click on the 'Save' button. A verification test step is recorded.

   Details of the verification condition can be seen in the 'User Data' section of this test step
